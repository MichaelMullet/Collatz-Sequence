# Collatz-Sequence
### *"The simplest impossible math problem"*
This program lets a user type an integer that keeps calling `collatz()` on that number until the function returns the value 1.

**No matter the integer, this sequence will eventually arrive at 1!**

The collatz conjecture is described by mathemeticians as an impossible problem, as we cannot determine whether or not every integer arrives at 1 after enough iterations.
